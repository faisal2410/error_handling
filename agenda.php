1. Introduction to Error Handling in PHP
Narration: "In PHP, error handling is a critical part of managing and debugging applications. In object-oriented programming (OOP), structured error handling allows us to capture issues effectively and take specific actions to ensure smooth execution."

2. Basic Error Handling Techniques
Narration: "Let's begin with a basic approach to error handling. PHP's error control operators, like the @ operator, allow you to suppress errors temporarily. However, in professional code, it's recommended to use try-catch blocks and custom error handlers for a cleaner approach."

3. Using error_reporting() for Custom Error Levels
Narration: "Next, let’s discuss error_reporting(). This function allows you to define the types of errors that should be reported. This can be very helpful for development versus production environments, where we may want to see different levels of error details."

4.Configuring Error Display with ini_set()
Narration: "PHP’s ini_set() function is useful to modify runtime configurations, such as turning error display on or off. While developing, we may set errors to display directly on the page for easier debugging, but in production, it's better to log errors to avoid displaying them to users."

5. Overview of PHP Error Constants: E_NOTICE, E_WARNING, and More
Narration: "Finally, let's look at the PHP error constants. PHP has various error levels that represent different types of issues. Some commonly used constants include E_NOTICE for minor errors, E_WARNING for non-fatal runtime errors, and E_ERROR for serious issues that stop script execution."
